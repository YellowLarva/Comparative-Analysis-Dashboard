## Contributing
This Report welcomes contributions and suggestions. This Pbix file Contains data of a company with its Product, Sales and Budget estimated.

## Overview

Comparative analysis refers to the comparison of two or more processes, documents, data sets or other objects. 
Pattern analysis, filtering and decision-tree analytics are forms of comparative analysis.

In this Report, I have used dax functions apart from normal filter condition as to calculate some of fields like 
Current Year (Sales), Previous Year (Sales), Budgeted Sales, YoY Growth (%) and Budget variance (%).

Also In this dashboard I have used tooltip for understanding the number better on CY Sales by category, YoY Sales Growth % and on Matrix table. I have also done some 
Data Modeling as to integrate different dataset properly. As I am still learning, I request you all to review the work and provide your valuable feedback.
